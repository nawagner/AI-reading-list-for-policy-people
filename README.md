# My reading list
This repository is intended for someone who wants to get up-to-speed with AI in a policy professional capacity. It is not intended to turn you into a full time AI system developer, but it should allow you to talk intelligently with one.

# Classes
* [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)
    * Free course offered by the University of Helsinki intended for general public audiences around the world.
* [AI for Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-everyone/)
    * Introductory course taught by Coursera and Google Brain cofounder Andrew Ng. Andrew is generally considered bullish on AI technology and believes catastrophic risks are overblown with applications rather than models the proper subject of regulation. 
* [Generative AI for Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/)
    * Similar to AI for Everyone course but updated after ChatGPT and image generation models became common.
* [AI Safety: Intro to Transformative AI](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/intro-to-tai/)
    * BlueDot Impact focuses on educating people about transformative AI and potential catastrophic risks. They have several other courses on AI governance, economic impacts of AI, and AI alignment. The AI safety mindset in their materials largely dominated the Biden administration's approach to frontier AI.

# Effects on particular sectors (you may need to root around for AI specific articles)
* Tech Industry
    * [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)
    * [Dwarkesh Podcast](https://www.dwarkesh.com/)
* China Policy
    * [ChinAI](https://chinai.substack.com/)
    * [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/)
* Advanced semiconductors
    * [Semianalysis](https://semianalysis.com/)
* Biotech
    * [In the Pipeline](https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline)
* Cybersecurity 
    * [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/)
* Global Health Security and Wildlife Conservation
    * [BlueDot (different BlueDot) detects COVID-19 before the world is aware.](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/bluedot/)
    * [Detecting poachers with TrailGuard AI](https://globalconservation.org/trailguard-ai)
    * [Predicting poaching hotspots with PAWS](https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2020/06/preventing-poaching)
* Materials Science
    * [Accelerating Materials Discovery with Microsoft](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/accelerating-materials-discovery-with-microsoft/id1448663986?i=1000654914768)
        * Podcast on how Microsoft demonstrated machine learning-assisted material discovery, particularly in the realm of lithium-ion battery electrolytes. The host, Taylor Sparks, is generally a good person to follow here.
    * [The Future of Material Scientists in an Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202401401)
        * Short perspective on what AI could do for materials science. The rungs are generally correct, but some of the hypothesis generation tooling may come before the robotics advances.  
    
# If you want to be an AI developer yourself
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
    * Python is the lingua franca of machine learning and AI development
* [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
    * Many helpful technical courses that dive deep into the weeds
* If you want to understand machine learning algorithms at a technical level, you will need to be familiar with linear algebra and multivariate calculus. I do not have particular recommendations here. 

# Learning how to teach AI
* [TeachAI](https://www.teachai.org/)
    * The steering committee contains well respected institutions like Code.org, Khan Academy, Educational Testing Service (ets), and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) 
* [AI for Education](https://www.aiforeducation.io/)
    * For profit consultancy type shop helping educators adopt AI. They have many educator partnerships and a helpful blog.
