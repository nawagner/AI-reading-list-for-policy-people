# AI reading list
This repository is intended for someone who wants to get up-to-speed with AI in a policy professional capacity. It is not primarily intended to turn you into a full time AI system developer, but it should allow you to talk intelligently with one.

# Classes
* [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)
    * Free course offered by the University of Helsinki intended for general public audiences around the world.
* [AI for Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-everyone/)
    * Introductory course taught by Coursera and Google Brain cofounder Andrew Ng. Andrew is generally considered bullish on AI technology and believes catastrophic risks are overblown with applications rather than models the proper subject of regulation. 
* [Generative AI for Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/)
    * Similar to AI for Everyone course but updated after ChatGPT and image generation models became common.  
* [AI Safety: Intro to Transformative AI](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/intro-to-tai/)
    * BlueDot Impact focuses on educating people about transformative AI and potential catastrophic risks. They have several other courses on AI governance, economic impacts of AI, and AI alignment. The AI Safety mindset in their materials largely dominated the Biden administration's approach to frontier AI.
